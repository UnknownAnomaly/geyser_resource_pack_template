# geyser_resource_pack_template
(More steps in the future so anybody can understand this easier and hopefully promote more community creations)

How to use 

1. Drag custom_mappings folder into your Geyser plugin folder

2. Update manifest with 2 new generated UUID's from https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4

3. Rezip resource_pack, convert to .mcpack, and place in packs folder located in Geyser plugin folder

Description and Name in manifest can also be changed

Things to be added

• Oraxen and ItemsAdder config that goes with this

• More template variations (items,models,etc.) for things that people seem to have trouble with

• Implementation of Model Engine 3 and Geyser's new custom entity api and zimzaza4's new GeyserModelEngine plugin

• Possibly a Wiki page for an easier to read layout of more configuration info
